[Snell's law][snell], proved by [Willebrord Snellius][snellius], states that
the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equivalent
to the ratio of the indicies of refraction.

<p>n<sub>i</sub>sin(θ<sub>i</sub>) = n<sub>r</sub>sin(θ<sub>r</sub>)

<p>Drag around the circle (or double-click anywhere) to change the angle of the
incident ray, and watch how the refracted ray reacts.

<p>Change the indicies of refraction with the sliders, number input boxes, or
drop-down menus. Five “unknown” values are
included --- substitute the known values into Snell’s law to find them!
