This is a list of scientific studies and opinion pieces / anecdotes from trans
people seeking to affirm several of my core beliefs — which are widely held
within the trans community:

* Trans people (should) own their bodies completely. With this right to bodily
  autonomy comes the right to choose when and how to transition, no matter if
  that means just dressing differently, HRT, or surgeries (although for a
  variety of reasons the majority of trans people don’t elect to get bottom
  surgery and many opt to not get any surgeries at all).

* Trans people are happier when they’re allowed to transition, which manifests
  in improved mental health and increased stability. Similar effects are
  observed when parents and families support trans youth.

* Depending on your relationship to them, supporting a trans person can be
  simple or complex. Here’s an incomplete list of things you can — and *should*
  do:
  * Use their name and pronouns i.e. the name and pronouns they’ve told you to
    use for them. They are not preferred, they are mandatory.
