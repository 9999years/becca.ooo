i like typography, fountain pens, sunglasses, computers, math, physics (which i
am terrible at), linguistics, modern art, film, and plants

i was born in 1998 and i live near boston or sometimes washington dc. my
pronouns are [she/her][she], and my mbti is infp, probably

i write code often using vim, which i am fanatic about, although i’m beginning
to appreciate ides more. i think static analysis and tdd is cool

i make many different kinds of [art](/art) in my free time. i enjoy both coffee
and tea.  i get a lot of nosebleeds and spend some of my free time gardening

maybe you’d be more interested in some of my [projects](/projects)?
