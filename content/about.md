i like typography, fountain pens, sunglasses, computers,
calculus, physics (which i am terrible at), linguistics, modern art,
angsty poetry, film, and plants.

i was born in 1998 and i live near washington dc or boston. my pronouns are
[she/her][she], and my mbti is infp, i think.

i write code often using vim, which i am fanatic about.

i make many different kinds of [art](/art) in my free
time

i enjoy both coffee and tea.

i get a lot of nosebleeds and spend some of my free time
gardening.

maybe youâ€™d be more interested in some of my [projects](/projects)?
