## Open Source
I have published packages on [PyPI][PyPI] (Python) as
[9999years][PyPI-9999years] and [CTAN][CTAN] (LaTeX) as [turner][CTAN-turner].
I have contributed code and documentation to a variety of open source projects;
selected pull requests include:

- [pypa/packaging.python.org#457](https://github.com/pypa/packaging.python.org/pull/457)
- [pypa/sampleproject#66](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/pull/66)

## Independent projects
I have developed a number of independent software projects, including:

- [I C the Light][i-c-the-light], a distance-estimating ray marcher designed to
  render images of quaternion Julia sets. Paper:
  [becca.ooo/i-c-the-light.pdf][light-paper] (Written in C)
- juliaplotter, a script to render cells or grids of arbitrary Julia sets, to
  overcome difficulties other renderers have in visualizing the many possible
  values of the constant c in the Julia set for a given rational function.
  (Python, GitHub: 9999years/juliaplotter)
- [#wrap][wrap] ([GitHub][wrap-GitHub]), an extension for Google Chrome to wrap
  Tumblr’s hashtag interface to one line, addressing a widely-held annoyance
  with Tumblr’s user interface. Three years after its publication, #wrap had
  retained 30,315 active users. (CSS)
- [becca.ooo/mandelbrot](/mandelbrot), an interactive web app to explore the
  Mandelbrot set and visualize incremental values of the underlying sequence at
  arbitrary points. (HTML 5 canvas, Javascript.)
- [Twitter bots] such as [@gardensbot], which posts grids of plant and animal
  emoji in virtual “gardens” every other hour, and [@goodwordsbot], which
  generates fake but plausible English words from Latin and Greek roots. (PHP)
- [The Daily Report], a highly-customizable framework for generating daily
  agendas for use with receipt printers. Capable of reading and processing
  Google calendars, outputting weather forecasts, countdowns, to-dos, daily
  news, and other useful information. Currently running on a Raspberry Pi
  interfacing with a Star thermal receipt printer. (Python)
- [becca.ooo/fox](/fox), a program to simulate and visualize the interactions
  of plant and animal populations in a virtual ecosystem. (HTML 5 canvas,
  Javascript.)
